<h1>Hi, I'm Sijia!</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Alicia, and I'm making a career change from Accounting to Information Technology. So far, I've taken several classes, obtained the Google IT Support Professional certificate, and am currently working on obtaining CompTIA A+ as well. I also have a project I did with MySQL listed below (there are more to come!) Thank you so much for checking out my portfolio!</p>
